# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the repository for the peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

First, the script "run_analysis.R" manages to download the file data, from the link provided on Coursera web site, and to unzip the folder. Subsequently it 
reads the different datasets and merges them in a unique tidy dataset extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Last it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and writes it to a text file named "dataAssisment.txt".

Read the codebook "CodeBook.md" for an explanation of the variables and data in "dataAssisment.txt".
